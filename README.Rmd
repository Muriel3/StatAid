[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

`StatAid` is a free open-source software provided as an R package allowing clinicians and researchers to perform statistical analysis through an intuitive graphical interface. It has been developed with the R software, using the [Shiny package](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). [Golem](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) has been used for package compilation and deployment.  

 The software guides the users through the steps of a good data analysis, including multiple features such as:
<ul><li> Exploratory data analysis: distribution, count, missing-values and outliers check</li>
<li> Descriptive analysis, simple comparative analysis and publication ready 'table 1' output </li>
<li> Publication-ready graph customization</li>
<li> Paired data analysis (case-control studies, repeated measures) </li>
<li> Univariate analysis and models for continuous and categorical outcome: Correlation, linear and logistic regression</li>
<li> Univariate analysis and models for time-dependent outcome: Kaplan-Meier curves and cox regression </li>
<li> Multivariate analysis and models for continuous, categorical and time-dependent outcomes </li></ul>
