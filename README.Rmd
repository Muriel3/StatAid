# Welcome to StatAid

StatAid is a free open-source statistical software designed for life-science applied data analysis. It has been developed with the R software, using the [Shiny package](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). [Golem](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) has been used for package compilation and deployment.  

# Getting started

## Online version 

StatAid has a ready-to-use online version available at [https://vincentalcazer.shinyapps.io/StatAid/](https://vincentalcazer.shinyapps.io/StatAid/).

## Local version

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/VincentAlcazer/StatAid) else by cloning the repository or directly by downloading the package in R:

```{r Github install }

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("VincentAlcazer/StatAid")

run_app()
```


You can also use StatAid locally 


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(StatAid)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
